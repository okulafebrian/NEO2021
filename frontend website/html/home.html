                      Luminescence is the emission of lights with a long radiation wavelength but lower energy than any light. Even though these lights have lower energy, they would still shine as brightly as they can in the darkest places.
                      With the darkness lighted, the brightest light can be seen.

                      In this time, covid-19 has pervaded our society and constrained our activity. People are compelled to distance themselves from others, have their activity suspended or delayed. The concept “The glory of my glow”
                      carries a meaning of empowering people to be more courageous in displaying their talent, whatever it is, and have confidence in it.

                <li>
                  Before each round starts, there will be a Technical Check to ensure that participants' mic and camera are functioning (audio must be clear and without echo, static, or other excessive noise). The camera must be stable to
                  prevent unwanted movement.
                </li>
                <li>There will be a roll call before every round starts. All participants will be called a maximum of three times before being considered as a walk-out or disqualified.</li>
                <li>Every participant should standby in the chatroom 30 minutes before their performance. The participants must consent the performance to be recorded to avoid any misjudgment from a bad connection.</li>
                <li>The participants’ facial expressions must be visible throughout the debate.</li>
                <li>Participants are highly recommended to use laptops or smartphones to prevent sudden disconnection if a blackout happens during the performance.</li>

                <li>Draw Release will be published on the tab page and WhatsApp group, and debaters will receive a Zoom link in the tab page and WhatsApp group.</li>
                <li>
                  After all of the participants have been informed about their draws and positions, they must rename their Zoom display name with the format:

                <li>
                  A team is allowed to use one device for the two members to perform; just change the Zoom display name with the format:

                <li>The committee will still execute the motion release even though some participants are not in the meeting yet. Please always check the WhatsApp group or tab page for motions.</li>
                <li>Debaters will be given 15 minutes for case building after the motion is released.</li>
                <li>When the motion is released, breakout rooms (the debate room) will be opened. Then, participants will be assigned to their predetermined debate room.</li>
                <li>
                  If debater(s) are not present when the debate starts, all debaters in the room will wait for the missing debater(s) for 2 minutes while the committee is contacting the missing debaters in the WhatsApp group. If the missing
                  debater(s) are still not present after 2 minutes, the committee will send a swing team to the room. The missing debater(s) will be dropped for that round and allocated to the next round.

                  If debater(s) suddenly get disconnected when debating, all the debater(s) in the room will wait for 2 minutes for them to reconnect. If the whole team gets disconnected, the waiting time will be extended to 5 minutes. If
                  the disconnected debater(s) are unable to reconnect within 5 minutes, the disconnected debater(s) will be considered missing. If the disconnected debater(s) haven’t given any statement, the teammate will speak on the
                  disconnected debater’s behalf.
                </li>
                <li>POI can be offered through chat in the debate room, or by quickly turning on the participant's microphone to say “POI” and turn it off again.</li>

                  After the OA/Verbal is delivered to debaters, all teams are encouraged to give adjudicators feedback scores based on the OA/Verbal given by the participants’ chair. The adjudicators’ feedback can be given via the tab page.

                  <p class="fw-normal">
                    Participants are assigned a genre, subject, and character assignment for their story and in any perspective (e.g. first person, third person). The genre is free to choose from listed genres. A subject and character will
                    be given randomly by the committee. The story must include the chosen genre, the assigned subject, and the assigned character. The assigned subject must be integral to the plot of the story. If the assigned subject
                    barely makes an appearance and isn't relevant to the story, there will be a point deduction. The assigned character doesn’t need to be the main character, but they must be relevant to the participants’ story. If the
                    character is only mentioned and passes by, there will be a point deduction.

            <p>
              This year, NEO has decided to add a Debate competition to widen the opportunities for those interested in expressing themselves through comprehensive analysis and battling opinions with others with different points of view.
            </p>
            <p>
              Debate is a process of proposing arguments between two opposite sides. The two sides are “Pro”, who agrees with the initial statement, and “Con”, who disagrees with the initial statement. The objective of a debate is to decide
              which side is right from the logical arguments, accompanied by clear and concrete evidence from the debaters.
